This is a simple project to keep track of the files and setting I needed to change
in order to get Ubuntu Working on the Sony Vaio. This setup is for Ubuntu 10.10.

To install the packages from the list but besure to have the apt/sources.list copied and performed an apt-get update:
dpkg --set-selections < installed-software
dselect


-------------------------
Some key points, the etc/default/grub  has the touchpad fix (i8042.nopnp). It has some extras that was supposed to be fore sleep/hibernate fix, but that is fixed in etc/pm/sleep.d

The Xorg conf I have is for my setup as I do not have two monitors to connect to this and I generally use it with one monitor and the laptop lid closed. Note the disper helps with this. disper -s == primary monitor and disper -S == secondary monitor. 

The xterm in the bin is simply because I could not get the color preferences to stick, so I made it a shell script to call xterm with the defaults, seems to work just fine.
