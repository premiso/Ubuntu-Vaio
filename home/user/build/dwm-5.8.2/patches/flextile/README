Usage
With the default configuration (see above) the original tile layout is emulated. You can change the layout by adjusting the four parameters layout axis, master axis, stack axis and master split (description see above) by pressing the appropriate keys. The original tile layout is only available by setting the above parameters, but not as a discrete layout; the monocle layout is still available by pressing ALT+m (in the default configuration).
